### Brief:
For this assignment, we added code to an existing Budget Tracker application in order to allow for offline access and functionality.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.

#### User Story
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.

### Website Demo

### Lessons Learned:

 * Going for a surf instead of class can make things SUPER hard
 * Can definitely see how this makes a website more accessible
 * Unsure really how to cache content from CDN. Looked up something called foreign fetch but it has been deprectated March 2020
